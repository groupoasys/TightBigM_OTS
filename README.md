# TightBigM_OTS

The aim of this repository is to provide details of the data sets and code used in the related research titled *Tight big-Ms for optimal transmission switching*.

The following files are included in this repository:
* `case118Blumsack.m`: Contains the network data for the 118-bus system, including topology, line parameters, and other relevant information.
* `Data100instances.csv`: Provides the node demand data for 100 instances and the switchable status of each transmission line (`1` for switchable, `0` for non-switchable).
